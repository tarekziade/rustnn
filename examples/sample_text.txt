The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This is a sample text for training a language model.
In machine learning, we often need training data to teach our models how to generate text.
This text will be used to train a simple transformer model using WebNN operations.
The model learns patterns in the text and can then generate similar text.
Training a language model requires lots of text data and computational resources.
However, this small example demonstrates the core concepts of next-token prediction.
Each word follows the previous words in a meaningful way, creating coherent sentences.
The transformer architecture with attention mechanisms is very powerful for this task.
WebNN allows us to run these models efficiently in web browsers and across different backends.
We can train on CPU, GPU, or even specialized hardware like Neural Processing Units.
This makes machine learning more accessible to everyone with a web browser.
The future of AI is running models locally on your device for privacy and speed.
Text generation has many applications: chatbots, writing assistants, code completion.
With enough training data, models can learn to write in different styles and domains.
This sample text is short, but it demonstrates the training pipeline nicely.
